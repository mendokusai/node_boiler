# Node Boiler

A quick boilerplate for node apps using express server/client, webpack and react. Nothing too fancy, probably lacking things and ordering decisions that _real_ people choose.

OH well. ðŸ“¯

---

### Start

`npm install` to load dependencies.

`webpack` to bundle client's `bundle.js`.

`nodemon [port]` to run in development, defaults to `3000` without port listed.

visit `localhost:3000` and get to hacking, haxor!
